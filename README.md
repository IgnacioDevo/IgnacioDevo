 I'm Ignacio Pacheco 👋☕💻


I am a 18 years olds Argentine interested in the world of technology, programming and the crypto world. Two years ago I had my first contact with development and applications. Since then I try to improve my skills daily and progress in my dream of being a web developer. I am also studying Systems at the university and learning in a self-taught way through courses and projects. In this git I will try to upload my progress day by day and see if I can create those great things that are on my mind for now.
